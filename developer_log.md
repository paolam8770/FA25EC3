A dated entry every time you work on the assignment

A description of what you worked on

Any bugs, issues, or problems you encountered

How you attempted to solve each issue

A brief explanation of every commit you make

A list of all files modified during each commit

Commit messages must also be descriptive, and the Developer Log must reflect the reasoning behind each commit.





12/6/25

* started assignment, worked on constructor and initializing the root ptr to null ptr
* first commit was today, files edited were developer\_log.md and tree.h, committed just to mark me starting the proj



12/7/25

* worked on creating createRoot --> handling if root is not nullptr with a return statement at the start, otherwise if it is equal to null then going through the steps
* still only edited / worked on tree.h and filling out the dev log



12/8

* working on find node --> kept running into issues with implementation of the dfs because i kept messing up the way to keep track of visited 
* for visited/found i initially tried doing something similar to what we did in prog3 but it turns out i didn't need anything for visited and then for found I just needed to switch from Boolean to Node type
* only edited and worked on tree.h and dev log



12/9

* started working through bugs in tree (had issues in create root - was overcomplicating)
* added comments to addnode 
* completed allocating tree memory and printall (created a print helper func for printall)



12/10

* uncommented items from main
* implemented playGame
* added comments
