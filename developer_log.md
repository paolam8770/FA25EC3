Your Developer Log must include:



A dated entry every time you work on the assignment

A description of what you worked on

Any bugs, issues, or problems you encountered

How you attempted to solve each issue

A brief explanation of every commit you make

A list of all files modified during each commit

Commit messages must also be descriptive, and the Developer Log must reflect the reasoning behind each commit.
